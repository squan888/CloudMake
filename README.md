Build an app using cloud Make

Cloud Make is a service offered by Esri to create stand-alone apps from your
AppStudio projects. When you create a stand-alone app, Player is not used.
Your app is wholly contained in an installation file that can be run on a
device. Press the Build Make tool to select which platforms to build for,
and request Esri's cloud Make to generate files for you.

This Git Hub project demonstrates invoking AppStudio's Cloud Make from script.
As a prerequisit, it requires bash and python to be installed and be part of
your system's PATH. For Windows, I recommend installing Git Bash.
